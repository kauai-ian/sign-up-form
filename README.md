# sign-up-form
Built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

The goal here was to create a sign up form that can work on different screen sizes, allows autocomplete of fields, and validates the form upon clicking the submit button. 

I added in some CSS animations to the logo and to the button; when all fields are valid the button glows with a rainbow outline.
